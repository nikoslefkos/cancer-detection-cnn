# Lung and colon cancer histopathological images classification with convolutional neural networks

## Description

This project presents the training of a convonutional neural network for the purpose of classifying lung and colon cancer histopathological images from the following dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/lung-and-colon-cancer-histopathological-images. 
The trained model can practically determine whether an image shows a healthy or a malignant tumor.
